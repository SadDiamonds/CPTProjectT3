# **The Document**

## **Week 1 - Brainstorming**

### Project Description
This project aims to develop an efficient charity platform that uses the process of matching donations with recipients' needs. The system categorises requests from individuals in need, allowing donated items to be sorted accordingly. When a donation matches a recipient's requirements, the platform automatically notifies the recipient, enabling them to collect the item at a designated location. This approach improves the efficiency and effectiveness of our charity giving by ensuring that donations reach those who need them most in a timely manner.

### Functional Requirements
- Users should be able to register into the website with a username and passwords and also they should be able to login with that credentials if in the case where they log out
- Users should be able to locate the position of interest where they can collect their donations/be able to donate their items
- Users should be able to identify what they are in need so that they get pinged when their item is available

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Website should be able to load within 1.5s
- All passwords should be encrypted for increased security also locations of users should be encrypted as well in case of a data leak
- The system should be able to handle at least 1000+ people at the same time without slowing down


## **Week 2 - Creating framework for the website**
|Aspect of Design|Description|

|Landing/Home page|The home page should display the logo and website name, along with the ability to navigate to different areas of the website such as donate, login/sign up,etc. It also should have to ability to swap the login with the user profile when the user is logged in, the page should also have description of the company's goal/purpose|
|Donate Page|This page is primarily for informing the donaters on why they should donate and the impacts of donating their items to help the needy, it also should display an interactive google maps displaying where the company HQ is, it also has description on becoming an volunteer since the company is a non-profit company.|

## **Week 3 - Alternate Design - Playing with Possibilities**
This week is for creating alternate designs for the website, I went with a warm and welcoming design mixed with simplicity to create a calming design where it does not impact the eyes too much, I changed the font to a blocky yet rounded font to create a sense of security.

I've also created a flow diagram to show the user flow of data across the pages.

### Alternate Design

**Page 1 - Home**

In the alternate design for the home page, I added extra buttons on the top so the user has a better time navigating through the website, I also added some "stories" where users can share their experiences.

**Page 2 - Donate**

In the alternate design for the Donate page, I simplified the page where the main focus is to explain to the donator what is happening when they donate, I also decided that the top yellow placeholder would be universal across the website.

**Page 3 - Login**

In the alternate design for the Login page, I removed the border and also enlargened the font so that all people can see.
