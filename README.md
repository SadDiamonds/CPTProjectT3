# **The Document**

## **Week 1 - Brainstorming**

### Project Description
This project aims to develop an efficient charity platform that uses the process of matching donations with recipients' needs. The system categorises requests from individuals in need, allowing donated items to be sorted accordingly. When a donation matches a recipient's requirements, the platform automatically notifies the recipient, enabling them to collect the item at a designated location. This approach improves the efficiency and effectiveness of our charity giving by ensuring that donations reach those who need them most in a timely manner.

### Functional Requirements
- Users should be able to register into the website with a username and passwords and also they should be able to login with that credentials if in the case where they log out
- Users should be able to locate the position of interest where they can collect their donations/be able to donate their items
- Users should be able to identify what they are in need so that they get pinged when their item is available

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Website should be able to load within 1.5s
- All passwords should be encrypted for increased security also locations of users should be encrypted as well in case of a data leak
- The system should be able to handle at least 1000+ people at the same time without slowing down
